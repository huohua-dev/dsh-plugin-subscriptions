/**
 * Quota tracking for pool members: polls the providers' usage endpoints

 * consumed per millisecond for the quota to be exactly used up at reset time
 * (`remaining / timeUntilReset`). Subscription quota does not roll over, so a
 * window about to reset with plenty left is the most urgent to spend — the
 * `quota_aware` strategy therefore prefers the highest-urgency member, which
 * over time converges on every window hitting zero right at its reset.
